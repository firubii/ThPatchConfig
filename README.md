# ThPatchConfig
A GUI tool for configurating and launching [thcrap](https://www.thpatch.net/wiki/Touhou_Patch_Center:Download).

---

I got tired of going through the entire process of using the thcrap console so I made my own GUI instead.

This program can quickly manage thcrap config json files, download patches, and launch and scan Touhou games with the thcrap patching tool.
The exe is required to be placed in the same folder as thcrap, it won't start without detecting the `thcrap_loader.exe` executable.
